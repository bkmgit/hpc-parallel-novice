# Learning Outline 

## Paradigms of Parallel Computing

This material will guide learners through the process of
performing a HPC simulation (code available),
and a high-throughput analysis (code available) of related data. The end goal will be to compare the simulation to the data (i.e. to relate their actions on a HPC installation to the scientific method).

For this, they will develop the workflow for a specific research scenario,
for example:

> Lola was hired by a research lab to help prepare the purchase of a multi-million dollar experiment.
> The experiment is known to fail at temperatures that are too low or too high.
> She knows that the temperature changes follow a daily pattern,
> and she's written some code to simulate these temperature changes.
> After running this code and generating the temperature predictions,
> she determines how closely her predictions match the actual temperature readings
> she has for every day in the last year.
> The simuation would take too long to run
> and generate too much data for her lab workstation,
> so she will use the local University's HPC facility for this work.
